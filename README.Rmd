# ghrecipes

The goal of ghrecipes is to provide helper functions for usual GitHub _data mining_ tasks, well at least the ones that are usual or useful for us. :smile_cat: Please suggest and discuss new recipes in [the issues tracker!](https://github.com/maelle/ghrecipes/issues)

It uses[ GitHub V4 API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) queried thanks to the [`ghql` package](https://github.com/ropensci/ghql). Read more about [GitHub V4 API advantages here](https://developer.github.com/v4/#why-is-github-using-graphql). It then formats results using the [`jqr` package](https://github.com/ropensci/jqr), interface to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). Read an intro to `jqr` power [here](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2017/12/11/data-rectangling-with-jq/). :rocket:

## Installation

You can install ghrecipes from GitHub with:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maelle/ghrecipes")
```

## Notes on use

* `ghql` creates a client on load, called `ghql_gh_cli`.

* See a very basic use case [here](http://www.masalmon.eu/2018/03/04/hrbrpkgs/).

## Examples

Don't miss conversations by your favorite developpers.

```{r}
convos <- ghrecipes::spy("github")
knitr::kable(convos)
```
